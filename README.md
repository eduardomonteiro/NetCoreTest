The API uses the presented json (I do not use the original url because there was an error in json's structure) and it takes its data and maintains it in a NoSql (Redis) structure.
And through your query, the data is queried from that database and presented to the client as requested.
Main structures / standards used: .NET Core, REST, OData, NoSQL, DOCKER, O.O., Dependency injection.
What is necessary to run the application? A. Have Docker running and press play in VS Debugger.
